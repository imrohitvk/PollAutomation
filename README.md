### 🎙️ ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) System

The ASR system is the heart of PollGen's intelligent question generation:

#### How ASR Works
1. **Audio Capture**: Host's microphone input is captured in real-time
2. **Stream Processing**: Audio is processed in chunks for continuous transcription
3. **Speech-to-Text**: Advanced speech recognition converts audio to text
4. **Context Analysis**: Transcribed text is analyzed for educational content
5. **Question Generation**: AI generates relevant poll questions from speech context

#### ASR Features
- **Real-time Processing**: Live transcription with minimal latency
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding of educational content and topics
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports various languages and accents
- **Noise Filtering**: Advanced audio processing for clear transcription
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves accuracy over time

### 🌐 WebSocket Communication

Real-time communication is powered by Socket.IO with these core functions:

#### Host WebSocket Events
```javascript
// Session Management
socket.emit('create-room', roomData)           // Create new session
socket.emit('host-end-session', roomId)        // End current session
socket.emit('launch-poll', pollData)           // Launch poll to students

// Real-time Updates
socket.on('participant-joined', callback)      // New student joins
socket.on('vote-submitted', callback)          // Student submits vote
socket.on('session-report-ready', callback)   // Final session report
```

#### Student WebSocket Events
```javascript
// Session Participation
socket.emit('student-join-room', roomCode)     // Join session with code
socket.emit('student-submit-vote', voteData)   // Submit poll answer

// Real-time Updates
socket.on('poll-started', callback)            // New poll available
socket.on('poll-ended', callback)              // Poll voting ended
socket.on('session-ended', callback)          // Session terminated
socket.on('leaderboard-updated', callback)    // Live leaderboard changes
```

#### Core WebSocket Functions
- **Room Management**: Create, join, and manage session rooms
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Instant updates across all participants
- **Event Broadcasting**: Efficient message distribution to room participants
- **Connection Management**: Handle disconnections and reconnections
